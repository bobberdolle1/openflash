## What is OpenFlash?

OpenFlash is an open-source toolkit for reading, writing, and analyzing NAND flash memory. It consists of:

1. **Desktop Application** - Cross-platform GUI for controlling operations
2. **Firmware** - Minimal code running on cheap microcontrollers
3. **Core Library** - Shared logic for ECC, chip detection, and analysis

## Philosophy

> "Cheap hardware, premium software"

All complex logic runs on your computer, not the microcontroller. This means:
- ✅ Cheap hardware (~$5 for a Raspberry Pi Pico)
- ✅ Easy firmware updates
- ✅ Powerful analysis tools
- ✅ Cross-platform support

## Use Cases

- **Firmware extraction** from routers, IoT devices, game consoles
- **Data recovery** from damaged flash storage
- **Security research** and reverse engineering
- **Embedded development** and debugging
- **Educational purposes** - learn how NAND flash works
